## Production Readiness Guide

### Configuration and Flags
- Centralize configuration via environment variables and typed adapters.
- Layered config: defaults → env → secret store → runtime flags.
- Feature flags: enable/disable experimental or costly features safely.

### API and Contracts
- Versioned APIs (`/api/v1`).
- Backward-compatible schema changes; contract tests and OpenAPI publishing.
- Standard pagination/filtering/sorting; consistent error model.

### Security & Privacy
- RBAC/ABAC roles with least privilege.
- Secrets in vault; rotate keys; TLS enforced.
- Redact sensitive values; audit access.

### Observability
- Structured logs with correlation IDs.
- Metrics and tracing via OpenTelemetry; dashboards and alerts.

### Reliability
- Idempotency and retries with jitter.
- Migrations with Alembic; backups; PITR.
- Background workers for heavy tasks.

### Performance
- Caching where safe; async I/O; bulk writes.
- Pagination and virtualization for large lists.

### Testing
- Unit, API, E2E, contract, and load tests.
- Deterministic seeded data; CI flaky-test policy.

### CI/CD
- Lint → type-check → tests → scan → build → deploy.
- Multi-env pipelines; blue/green or canary.

### Data Governance & Cost
- Token/cost accounting with budgets and alerts.
- Retention policies and export controls.

### SLOs & Operations
- Define SLOs (availability, p95 latency) and alerts.
- Health checks, graceful shutdowns, and runbooks.

### Extensibility
- Plugin-like agent/step registry and UI extension points.
