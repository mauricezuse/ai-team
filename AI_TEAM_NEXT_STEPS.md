# AI-Team: Recommended Next Steps & Ideas

## 1. Expand Agent Capabilities
- Add more agent roles (Architect, QA, Release Manager, etc.)
- Enhance workflow logic with multi-step, cross-agent processes
- Enable cross-agent communication and coordination

## 2. Improve Error Handling & Observability
- Integrate centralized logging/monitoring (e.g., Sentry, Datadog)
- Add alerting for integration failures (Slack, email, etc.)
- Implement retry and recovery logic for agent actions

## 3. Security & Compliance
- Integrate with a secret manager (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Add audit logging for all agent actions

## 4. Scalability & Deployment
- Harden Dockerfile for production
- Automate CI/CD deployment to cloud (Azure, AWS, etc.)
- Prepare for horizontal scaling (multiple agent instances)

## 5. User Experience (for AI agents)
- Implement agent feedback loops (learning from past actions)
- (Optional) Build a dashboard for agent/workflow configuration

## 6. Testing & Quality
- Add end-to-end workflow tests
- Implement mocked/replayable tests for CI
- Increase test coverage for all code paths

## 7. Documentation & Onboarding
- Expand README with usage, architecture, and troubleshooting
- Document each agent and workflow
- Provide onboarding scripts for new environments/contributors

## 8. Feature Ideas
- Dynamic workflow generation by agents
- Integrate with more tools (Slack, Teams, Confluence, Trello, etc.)
- Enable natural language command interpretation for agents

## Advanced Improvement Ideas

### 1. Prompt Optimization & Robustness
- Move all LLM prompts to versioned, editable templates (YAML or Markdown) for easier tuning and A/B testing.
- Use stricter parsing and validation of LLM outputs (e.g., with Pydantic models or JSON schema) to catch hallucinations or format errors early.
- Add retry/correction loops: if the LLM output is invalid, automatically re-prompt with a correction hint.
- **[NEW] Implement LLM output caching:** Architect agent now caches LLM outputs to reduce rate limits. Extend to other agents for further improvement.

### 2. Codebase Indexing & Context
- Implement incremental indexing: only re-index files that have changed since the last run (using git diff or file timestamps).
- Use semantic search/embeddings to select files by similarity to the story/task, not just by name.
- Summarize large files or only include function/class signatures in the index, not full code or docstrings.

### 3. Agent Collaboration & Feedback
- Allow reviewer/tester agents to provide feedback that can trigger a re-implementation or refinement loop by the developer.
- Add optional human-in-the-loop approval/feedback steps for each agent's output before proceeding.

### 4. Performance & Cost
- Batch LLM calls where possible (e.g., generate tests for multiple files in one call).
- Use smaller/cheaper models for file selection, and larger models for planning/implementation.
- Log and analyze token usage per step to optimize the most expensive calls.

### 5. Workflow & Traceability
- Add structured logs for every agent step, including prompt, output, and token usage.
- Allow resuming from any step, not just the last checkpoint, for faster recovery and debugging.
- Auto-generate detailed PR descriptions summarizing all tasks, code changes, and tests.

### 6. Testing & Quality
- Require a minimum test coverage delta for each PR (integrate with coverage tools).
- Automatically run Playwright and backend tests after generation, and report results in the PR.

### 7. User Experience
- Build a simple dashboard to visualize workflow progress, agent outputs, and logs.
- Allow users to customize which agents/steps are run for each story.

### 8. Security & Safety
- Ensure no secrets or sensitive data are included in LLM prompts or logs.
- Run generated code/tests in a sandboxed environment before committing.
