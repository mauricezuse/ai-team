- Integrate with more tools (Slack, Teams, Confluence, Trello, etc.)
- Enable natural language command interpretation for agents

## Advanced Improvement Ideas

### 1. Prompt Optimization & Robustness
- Move all LLM prompts to versioned, editable templates (YAML or Markdown) for easier tuning and A/B testing.
- Use stricter parsing and validation of LLM outputs (e.g., with Pydantic models or JSON schema) to catch hallucinations or format errors early.
- Add retry/correction loops: if the LLM output is invalid, automatically re-prompt with a correction hint.
- **[NEW] Implement LLM output caching:** Architect agent now caches LLM outputs to reduce rate limits. Extend to other agents for further improvement.

### 2. Codebase Indexing & Context
- Implement incremental indexing: only re-index files that have changed since the last run (using git diff or file timestamps).
- Use semantic search/embeddings to select files by similarity to the story/task, not just by name.
- Summarize large files or only include function/class signatures in the index, not full code or docstrings.

### 3. Agent Collaboration & Feedback
- Allow reviewer/tester agents to provide feedback that can trigger a re-implementation or refinement loop by the developer.
- Add optional human-in-the-loop approval/feedback steps for each agent's output before proceeding.

### 4. Performance & Cost
- Batch LLM calls where possible (e.g., generate tests for multiple files in one call).
- Use smaller/cheaper models for file selection, and larger models for planning/implementation.
- Log and analyze token usage per step to optimize the most expensive calls.

### 5. Workflow & Traceability
- Add structured logs for every agent step, including prompt, output, and token usage.
- Allow resuming from any step, not just the last checkpoint, for faster recovery and debugging.
- Auto-generate detailed PR descriptions summarizing all tasks, code changes, and tests.

### 6. Testing & Quality
- Require a minimum test coverage delta for each PR (integrate with coverage tools).
- Automatically run Playwright and backend tests after generation, and report results in the PR.

### 7. User Experience
- Build a simple dashboard to visualize workflow progress, agent outputs, and logs.
- Allow users to customize which agents/steps are run for each story.

### 8. Security & Safety
- Ensure no secrets or sensitive data are included in LLM prompts or logs.
- Run generated code/tests in a sandboxed environment before committing.

# Next Steps: Modular Developer/Frontend Agent Architecture

## 1. Design a Robust BaseAgent Class
- **Location:** `crewai_app/agents/base.py`
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Common LLM interaction logic (prompting, retries, caching, logging)
  - Output parsing/validation utilities (e.g., code fence stripping, list extraction)
  - Error handling and fallback strategies
  - Collaboration hooks (escalate/route tasks to other agents: frontend, backend, architect, PM)
  - Shared context management (API contracts, UI specs)
- **Extensibility:** Both `DeveloperAgent` (backend) and `FrontendAgent` (Angular) will inherit from this class.

## 2. Implement Specialized Agents
- **Backend (`DeveloperAgent`):**
  - Inherits from `BaseAgent`.
  - Focuses on Python/FastAPI code, backend tests, and API contracts.
- **Frontend (`FrontendAgent`):**
  - Inherits from `BaseAgent`.
  - Focuses on Angular (with Native Federation), TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, and Playwright/Jasmine tests.
  - **Prompt must include:**
    - Angular Native Federation is used.
    - Do **not** upgrade or modify core files (Angular, Native Federation, etc).
    - The shell is in `/shell`; the only module to use is `/freelancer/profile`.
    - `/freelancer/profile` contains components for both freelancer and client.
    - UI components must follow strict design rules for consistent look and feel (see below).
  - **UI Consistency Rules:**
    - Use shared styles/components from a designated shared module.
    - Follow a design system (color palette, spacing, typography).
    - All new components must use the same layout, button, and form field styles as existing ones.
    - Responsive and accessible by default.

## 3. Prompt Engineering
- **Frontend Prompt Additions:**
  - "This project uses Angular Native Federation. Do not upgrade or modify any core Angular or federation files."
  - "The shell is located in `/shell`; only use the `/freelancer/profile` module for new components."
  - "Ensure all UI components follow the shared design system for look and feel consistency."
  - "If backend changes are required, collaborate with the backend agent. If architectural or requirements clarification is needed, escalate to the architect or PM agent."
- **Backend Prompt Additions:**
  - "If frontend changes are required, collaborate with the frontend agent. If requirements are unclear, escalate to the architect or PM agent."

## 4. Collaboration and Escalation
- **Agent Collaboration:**
  - Agents can pass context, API contracts, or UI specs to each other.
  - If a task requires changes outside their domain, they can "escalate" or "handoff" to the appropriate agent (frontend, backend, architect, PM).
  - Collaboration is logged and tracked for traceability.
- **Escalation Triggers:**
  - Unclear requirements, missing API contracts, or design ambiguities.
  - Need for new endpoints or UI elements not covered in the plan.

## 5. Workflow Integration
- **Task Routing:**
  - The workflow routes tasks to the appropriate agent based on file type, directory, or explicit task type.
  - Collaboration/escalation is supported mid-task if needed.
- **Shared Context:**
  - Agents can access and update a shared context object (API contracts, UI specs, design tokens).

## 6. Testing and Documentation
- **Unit and integration tests** for both agents and the base class.
- **Documentation** for:
  - Agent responsibilities and collaboration patterns.
  - UI design system and component structure rules.
  - How to escalate or collaborate between agents.

## Deliverables
- `crewai_app/agents/base.py`: BaseAgent class with shared logic and collaboration hooks.
- `crewai_app/agents/developer.py`: Refactored DeveloperAgent (backend) inheriting from BaseAgent.
- `crewai_app/agents/frontend.py`: New FrontendAgent (Angular) inheriting from BaseAgent, with strict prompt and UI rules.
- Updated workflow logic for agent routing and collaboration.
- Tests and documentation.
